  <h1>Is the new "template.subscribe() reactive? (No!)"</h1>

  <p>
    We are subscribing to the list of People (who have "name" and "age" properties)
    and we use the button to change the "age" via Session variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    EXPECTED: the instansce-method <b>this.subscribe('people', Session.get('age'))</b> for the <i>Template.people</i> should:
    <ol>
      <li>
        re-run upon the change of "age" and re-subscribe to the "people" publication;
      </li>
      <li>
        only show People who have "age" equal to the one set via Session.set('age', x).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  {{> people}}

  <p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    So, in order to make <b>"template.subscribe()"</b> reactively re-subscribe we need to put it inside another template-instance-method called <b>"template.autorun()"</b>
    <a href="https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/Blaze-TemplateInstance-subscribe">
       like suggested by docs</a>
  </p>
</body>

<template name="people">
  <button>Change the Age</button>
  <p>You've set the "age" to: {{ageVar}}</p>
  <hr>
  <ul>
  {{#each persons}}
    <li>{{name}} is --- {{age}} years old.</li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>
  <hr>
</template>
